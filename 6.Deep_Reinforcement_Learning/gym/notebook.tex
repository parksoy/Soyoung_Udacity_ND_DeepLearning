    \section{\texorpdfstring{Deep
\(Q\)-learning}{Deep Q-learning}}\label{deep-q-learning}

In this notebook, we'll build a neural network that can learn to play
games through reinforcement learning. More specifically, we'll use
\(Q\)-learning to train an agent to play a game called
\href{https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0}{Cart-Pole}. In this game,
a freely swinging pole is attached to a cart. The cart can move to the
left and right, and the goal is to keep the pole upright as long as
possible.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{assets/cart-pole.jpg}
\caption{Cart-Pole}
\end{figure}

We can simulate this game using
\href{https://github.com/openai/gym}{OpenAI Gym}. First, let's check out
how OpenAI Gym works. Then, we'll get into training an agent to play the
Cart-Pole game.

  warnings.warn('DEPRECATION WARNING: to improve load times, gym no longer automatically loads gym.spaces. Please run "import gym.spaces" to load gym.spaces on your own. This warning will turn into an error in a future version of gym.')

    \end{Verbatim}

    We interact with the simulation through \texttt{env}. You can see how
many actions are possible from \texttt{env.action\_space.n}, and to get
a random action you can use \texttt{env.action\_space.sample()}. Passing
in an action as an integer to \texttt{env.step} will generate the next
step in the simulation. This is general to all Gym games.

In the Cart-Pole game, there are two possible actions, moving the cart
left or right. So there are two actions we can take, encoded as 0 and 1.

Run the code below to interact with the environment.

    We can look at the actions and rewards:

\end{Verbatim}


    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
Actions: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Rewards: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

    \end{Verbatim}

    The game resets after the pole has fallen past a certain angle. For each
step while the game is running, it returns a reward of 1.0. The longer
the game runs, the more reward we get. Then, our network's goal is to
maximize the reward by keeping the pole vertical. It will do this by
moving the cart to the left and the right.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\(Q\)-Network}{Q-Network}}\label{q-network}

To keep track of the action values, we'll use a neural network that
accepts a state \(s\) as input. The output will be \(Q\)-values for each
available action \(a\) (i.e., the output is \textbf{all} action values
\(Q(s,a)\) \emph{corresponding to the input state \(s\)}).

For this Cart-Pole game, the state has four values: the position and
velocity of the cart, and the position and velocity of the pole. Thus,
the neural network has \textbf{four inputs}, one for each value in the
state, and \textbf{two outputs}, one for each possible action.

As explored in the lesson, to get the training target, we'll first use
the context provided by the state \(s\) to choose an action \(a\), then
simulate the game using that action. This will get us the next state,
\(s'\), and the reward \(r\). With that, we can calculate
\(\hat{Q}(s,a) = r + \gamma \max_{a'}{Q(s', a')}\). Then we update the
weights by minimizing \((\hat{Q}(s,a) - Q(s,a))^2\).

Below is one implementation of the \(Q\)-network. It uses two fully
connected layers with ReLU activations. Two seems to be good enough,
three might be better. Feel free to try it out.

    \subsection{Experience replay}\label{experience-replay}

Reinforcement learning algorithms can have stability issues due to
correlations between states. To reduce correlations when training, we
can store the agent's experiences and later draw a random mini-batch of
those experiences to train on.

Here, we'll create a \texttt{Memory} object that will store our
experiences, our transitions \(<s, a, r, s'>\). This memory will have a
maximum capacity, so we can keep newer experiences in memory while
getting rid of older experiences. Then, we'll sample a random mini-batch
of transitions \(<s, a, r, s'>\) and train on those.

Below, I've implemented a \texttt{Memory} object. If you're unfamiliar
with \texttt{deque}, this is a double-ended queue. You can think of it
like a tube open on both sides. You can put objects in either side of
the tube. But if it's full, adding anything more will push an object out
the other side. This is a great data structure to use for the memory
buffer.

    \subsection{\texorpdfstring{\(Q\)-Learning training
algorithm}{Q-Learning training algorithm}}\label{q-learning-training-algorithm}

We will use the below algorithm to train the network. For this game, the
goal is to keep the pole upright for 195 frames. So we can start a new
episode once meeting that goal. The game ends if the pole tilts over too
far, or if the cart moves too far the left or right. When a game ends,
we'll start a new episode. Now, to train the agent:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Initialize the memory \(D\)
\item
  Initialize the action-value network \(Q\) with random weights
\item
  \textbf{For} episode \(\leftarrow 1\) \textbf{to} \(M\) \textbf{do}
\item
  Observe \(s_0\)
\item
  \textbf{For} \(t \leftarrow 0\) \textbf{to} \(T-1\) \textbf{do}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    With probability \(\epsilon\) select a random action \(a_t\),
    otherwise select \(a_t = \mathrm{argmax}_a Q(s_t,a)\)
  \item
    Execute action \(a_t\) in simulator and observe reward \(r_{t+1}\)
    and new state \(s_{t+1}\)
  \item
    Store transition \(<s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1}>\) in memory \(D\)
  \item
    Sample random mini-batch from \(D\): \(<s_j, a_j, r_j, s'_j>\)
  \item
    Set \(\hat{Q}_j = r_j\) if the episode ends at \(j+1\), otherwise
    set \(\hat{Q}_j = r_j + \gamma \max_{a'}{Q(s'_j, a')}\)
  \item
    Make a gradient descent step with loss
    \((\hat{Q}_j - Q(s_j, a_j))^2\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{endfor}
\item
  \textbf{endfor}
\end{itemize}

You are welcome (and encouraged!) to take the time to extend this code
to implement some of the improvements that we discussed in the lesson,
to include fixed \(Q\) targets, double DQNs, prioritized replay, and/or
dueling networks.

\subsection{Playing Atari Games}\label{playing-atari-games}

So, Cart-Pole is a pretty simple game. However, the same model can be
used to train an agent to play something much more complicated like Pong
or Space Invaders. Instead of a state like we're using here though,
you'd want to use convolutional layers to get the state from the screen
images.

\caption{Deep Q-Learning Atari}
\end{figure}

I'll leave it as a challenge for you to use deep Q-learning to train an
agent to play Atari games. Here's the original paper which will get you
started: http://www.davidqiu.com:8888/research/nature14236.pdf.
